Build multi-architecture [Orthanc](https://www.orthanc-server.com) DICOM-node Docker images.


## Overview

Orthanc is developed and maintained by Sébastien Jodogne. Full documentation is available in the [Orthanc Book](http://book.orthanc-server.com/users/docker.html).  

This repo is a fork of Sébastien Jodogne's [OrthancDocker](https://github.com/jodogne/OrthancDocker) project.  The new `xarch` branch builds images for the most recent default/mainline release version of Orthanc.  These images are manifested per modern Docker.io guidelines so that an appropriately architected image can be will automatically selected for a given tag depending on the pulling architecture.


## Use It

Images can be pulled from:

```bash
$ docker pull derekmerck/orthanc
$ docker pull derekmerck/orthanc-plugins
```

Images for specific architectures images can be directly pulled from the same namespace using the format `derekmerck/orthanc:tag-{arch}`, where `arch` is one of `amd64`, `arm32v7`, or `arm64v8`.  Explicit architecture specification is sometimes helpful when an indirect build service shadows the production architecture.


## Build It

These images are based on the cross-platform `resin/$ARCH-debian:stretch` image.  [Resin.io][] base images include the [QEMU][] cross-compiler to facilitate building Docker images for low-power single-board computers while using more powerful Intel-architecture compute servers.

[Resin.io]: http://resin.io
[QEMU]: https://www.qemu.org

This supports builds for `amd64`, `armhf`/`arm32v7`, and `aarch64`/`arm64v8` architectures.  Most low-power single board computers such as the [Raspberry Pi][] and [Beagleboard][] are `armhf`/`arm32v7` devices.  The [Pine64][] and [NVIDIA Jetson][] are `aarch64`/`arm64v8` devices.

[Beagleboard]: http://beagleboard.org
[Pine64]: https://www.pine64.org
[NVIDIA Jetson]: https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/buy/jetson-tx2

`docker-compose.yml` contains build recipes for all relevant architectures for both a vanilla `orthanc` image as well as `orthanc-plugins`.  `orthanc-plugins` is based on `orthanc`, but since we cannot define build dependencies in a compose file (strangely, `depends_on` only works with `run` or `up`), the vanilla `orthanc` image must be explicitly built before the `orthanc-plugins` image.

To build all images:

1. Register the Docker QEMU cross-compilers
2. Call `docker-compose` to build the vanilla `orthanc` images
3. Call `docker-compose` to build the `orthanc-plugin` images
4. Put Docker into "experimental mode" for manifest creation
5. Call `docker-manifest.py` with an appropriate domain to manifest and push the images

```bash
$ docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
$ docker-compose build orthanc-amd64 orthanc-arm32v7 orthanc-arm64v8
$ docker-compose bulid orthanc-plugins-amd64 orthanc-plugins-arm32v7 orthanc-plugins-arm64v8
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.docker && echo '{"experimental":"enabled"}' > "$HOME/.docker/config.json"
$ python3 docker-manifest.py --d $DOCKER_USERNAME orthanc
$ python3 docker-manifest.py --d $DOCKER_USERNAME orthanc-plugins
```

An automation pipeline for git-push-triggered image regeneration and tagging is demonstrated in the `.travis.yml` script.  However, these cross-compiling jobs exceed the [Travis][] 50-minute timeout window, so builds are currently done by hand on cloud infrastructure.

## Run Orthanc on ARM

[Packet.net][] rents bare-metal 96-core `aarch64` [Cavium ThunderX] servers for $0.50/hour.  Packet's affiliated [Works On Arm][] program provided build-time for developing and testing these cross-platform images.

You can confirm that the appropriate image has been pulled by inspecting the value of `.Config.Labels.architecture`.  (Note this is a creator-defined label that is _different_ than the `.Architecture` key -- which appears to _always_ report as `amd64`.)

```bash
$ docker pull derekmerck/orthanc
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from derekmerck/orthanc
Digest: sha256:1975e3a92cf9099284fc3bb2d05d3cf081d49babfd765f96f745cf8a23668ff6
Status: Downloaded newer image for derekmerck/orthanc:latest
$ docker inspect derekmerck/orthanc --format "{{ .Config.Labels.architecture }}"
arm64v8
```


## Why Bother?

On-board embedded AI is the future of medical imaging!  Orthanc provides a vital, robust bridge between modality-generated DICOM and modern data indexing and analysis algorithms.

This image is also drop-in compatible with the [derekmerck.orthanc-docker](https://github.com/derekmerck/ansible-orthanc-docker) [Ansible][] role, facilitating quick configuration of complex DICOM infrastructures on ARM data center equipment.

## Changes

- Rebased images from `_/ubuntu:14` to `resin/$ARCH-debian:stretch`
- Set locale using a [Debian-friendly method](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/246846/cant-generate-en-us-utf-8-locale)
- Refactored into two-stage build, with `orthanc-plugins` image based on `orthanc` image
- Specified `libssl1.0-dev` in `orthanc` image
- Added [GDCM][] CLI tools to `orthanc` image
- Refactored `command` to leave `entrypoint` available for init process
- `orthanc-postgresql` code-base updated to use `orthanc-databases` in `orthanc-plugins` image
